# Connect-4

To create a Connect 4 game with basic AI move choosing using the random() function. Choose yellow or red discs, and then take turns dropping coloured discs into a seven-column grid. When you get four discs in a row in two players, you win. When the computer selects what move to make next, it evaluates all of its available positions, but to simplify things, it utilises a random() function to select the column. To enhance this version, the minmax algorithm can be applied to ensure that the system wins with the best odds.
